    'Learn why proper hydration is crucial for your health and how IV therapy can help.',
    'Water is essential for life, yet many people are chronically dehydrated without realizing it. Proper hydration affects every system in your body.

## Signs of Dehydration
- Fatigue and low energy
- Headaches
- Dry skin and lips
- Dark urine
- Muscle cramps
- Difficulty concentrating

## Why Oral Hydration Isn''t Always Enough
While drinking water is important, sometimes your body needs more than oral fluids can provide:

### 1. Rapid Absorption
IV fluids are absorbed immediately into your bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system.

### 2. Electrolyte Balance
Our hydration drips include essential electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

### 3. Faster Recovery
Perfect for hangovers, illness recovery, or post-exercise rehydration.

## When to Consider IV Hydration
- After intense exercise
- During illness
- Hangover recovery
- Jet lag
- Chronic dehydration
- Before important events',
